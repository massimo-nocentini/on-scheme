    We are about to discuss `call/cc`. It is a procedure of one argument, called a `receiver`:
    `receiver` is a procedure of one argument, called a `continuation`. The `continuation`
    argument is also a procedure of one argument, defined as follows:
    let `e` be the expression containing
    subexpr `(call/cc receiver)`, then `(call/cc receiver)` yields `(receiver continuation)`,
    where `continuation` is bound to procedure `(escaper c)`, where `c` is the context of 
    `(call/cc receiver)` in expression `e`.
